# Technical Assignment

## General test requirements and instructions

> Make sure we can compile and run your code

The purpose of this test is evaluate your technical skills, design skills and ability to interpret requirements. At
Folksdev we value simple, readable and maintainable code. Use of third party libraries is acceptable, but ensure they
add sufficient value. They are open problems and there is no right or wrong answer.

## Problem

Paper-Rock-Scissors is a game for two players. Each player simultaneously opens his/her hand to display a symbol:

> - Fist equals rock
> - Open hand equals paper
> - Showing the index and middle finger equals scissors.

The winner is determined by the following schema:

> - Paper beats (wraps) rock
> - Rock beats (blunts) scissors
> - Scissors beats (cuts) paper.

Write a program that plays Paper-Rock-Scissors between the computer and a real player. You should be able to play the
game n times before the program exits.
